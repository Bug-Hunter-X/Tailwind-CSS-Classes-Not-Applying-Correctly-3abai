// Ensure that your Tailwind CSS configuration is correct and that your CSS is properly included in your project.
// Check for conflicting styles that might be overriding the Tailwind classes.
// Consider the order of your classes. The specificity of your selectors might be affecting the application of the hover effect.
// Use the developer tools of your browser to inspect the element and see which styles are applied to verify.
// Use !important in the class if needed, but only as a last resort to quickly fix the issue.
